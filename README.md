## Problem
Food waste is a pervasive issue with far-reaching implications on our livelihood. It leads to the squandering of valable resources, increased environmental harm, and economic losses. The repercussions of food waste go beyond the surface, affecting food security, hunger, and sustainable agriculture. Adressing food waste through innovative solutions, such as efficient management and consumer awareness, is essential to reduce these negative impacts. By doing so, we can promote responsible consumptions, alleviate food insecurity, and reduce the environmental footprint on out food production and distribution systems.

## Goal
The goal of this project is the development of a Food Waste Reduction System aimed at minimizing food waste, promoting responsible consumption, and decreasing the environmental platform for individuals, hosueholds, and businesses to manage their food inventory, receive real-time alerts for apporaching expiration dates, and access recipes and tips for utilizing surplus ingredients effectively. By empoowering users to make informed decisions about their food, we aimt to reduce food waste, alleviate hunger, and contribute to a more sustainable future while ensuring data security and privacy.

## Examples of computer science problems
Example of computer science problems include:
- Food Inventory Management Algorithm: implement an algorithm for efficient tracking of food items, considering factors such as expiration dates, quantities, and user preferences to reduce waste.
- Recipe Recommendation System: Develop a recommendation system that suggests recipes based on the ingredients users have in their inventory, promoting creative and efficient use of surplus food items.
- Expiration Date Alert System: Create a system that sends timely alerts to users about apporaching expiration dates for their food items, reducing the likelihood of spoilage.

## Examples of contextual questions and issues
- How can we ensure the security and privacy of users' food inventory data?
- What additional information or features can enhance the effectiveness of food waste reduction, such as local donation options or composting recommendations?
- How can we encourage businesses, restaurants, and supermarkets to participate in and benefit from this food waste reduction initiative?
